Contributing:
If you're interested in contributing, by all means do! Clone, and import to your workspace. The only issue that you should run into is one with NEI. There are two solutions:
  - Delete the bau5.mods.craftingbench.codechicken package from your workspace (don't push a deleted package pls). Or
  - You can copy CodeChickenCore & NEI to your mods folder under the mcp directory
      - mcp/jars/mods
If you're authoring a class, feel free to add that comment annotation at the top. 

Much of this is just me hacking away at random things, so improvements can definitely be made. Don't hesitate if you see some :)
